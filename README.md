# ELabs
CMS for ExperimentsLabs.com based on CakePHP 3

## Get started, IRC way :
```irc
[20:45] <elcms> the first thing is to lauch composer to download the deps, run the setup.sh if you're under Linux (it will download a plugin wich is not available with composer)... create your db and complete an config/app.php file
[20:45] <elcms> that's reaaly user-friendly, I assure you :P
[20:45] * elcms gets out...
[20:58] <sitex_rus_> it works!
[20:59] <elcms> really ?
[20:59] <elcms> XD yeah !
[21:01] <elcms> you may have to create an user at first, then change its status to 1 in db
[21:01] <sitex_rus_> done)
[21:01] <sitex_rus_> is it possible to add project? <.<
[21:02] <elcms> sure
[21:03] <elcms> you should create a license first
[21:03] <elcms> as you will bind your projects to licenses
[21:03] <elcms> (as files and posts)
[21:04] <elcms> all the text contents should be written in markdown
[21:04] <elcms> to create a license, go to admin/licenses/add
[21:05] <sitex_rus_> done
[21:06] <elcms> then once you're logged, use the "user menu" (top right), then "add a project"
```
