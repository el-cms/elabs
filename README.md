# ELabs
CMS for ExperimentsLabs.com based on CakePHP 3

## What is it ?
It's a small website made to make a presentation of projects, files and some articles... for now.

**In any case, that's not a modular CMS, with plugins and lot of stuff** (as [Croogo](http://croogo.org))

This structure allows :

  - multiple users
  - a simple "project management system" (a page about your project)
  - a simple article management system
  - a simple file upload system.
  - a report system for the visitors/users to report pages or items (may be extended as a way to leave comments to users too)
  - licenses support for any item published on the site

This structure does **not** have comments system (and will never have publicly shown comments)

## Why ?

I know there are a lot of tools existing around to make this kind of thing, but 
that was a way for me to approach CakePHP3 and finally make my own website.

## Get started:
First, download or clone the repository. Then, run setup.sh and follow the instructions. This will download extra js files, some sources if you want them, call `composer install` and populate the db.

## Future evolutions ?
You're welcome to use/reuse the code, fork, make pull requests...

I don't know yet how the website will evolve, but it will.

**Translations** are welcome :)

**Design improvements** are really welcome

**New ideas are welcome**

**If you want to help**, check the TODO.md, and look at all the amount of work there is...
